# 👋 Hello World, I'm [Your Name]  
Just a chill developer who loves machine learning, networking and playing around datas, experimenting with machine learning, and occasionally losing sleep over a single bug.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔬 Doing a thesis on **hybrid machine learning models for hate speech classification** (BERT + XGBoost)
- 💻 Mostly code in Python, but I like poking around with other tools and frameworks
- 📚 Love researching ML, NLP, and software architecture
- ✍️ Currently building things in Jupyter Notebook like a mad scientist
- ☕ Coffee is my build system

## 🎉 Fun Facts

- Everything in my repos is 100% built with ✨ curiosity ✨  
<!-- - I will refactor code at 3 AM and call it “productive” -->  
- I enjoy learning by breaking things  
- My hobby is explaining AI to people who think it’s magic  
<!-- - I have zero pets, but hundreds of virtual environments 🐍 -->

## 🧠 Currently Learning

- Advanced NLP and deep learning models  
- How to fine-tune BERT and not crash my laptop  
- Making my github and learning curver cooler than ThePrimeagen's (maybe)
